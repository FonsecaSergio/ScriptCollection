	sp_Blitz (TM) v29 - August 23, 2013
    
	(C) 2013, Brent Ozar Unlimited. 
	See http://BrentOzar.com/go/eula for the End User Licensing Agreement.

	To learn more, visit http://www.BrentOzar.com/blitz where you can download
	new versions for free, watch training videos on how it works, get more info on
	the findings, and more.  To contribute code and see your name in the change
	log, email your improvements & checks to Help@BrentOzar.com.

	Sample execution call with the most common parameters:

	EXEC [master].[dbo].[sp_Blitz]
		@CheckUserDatabaseObjects = 1 ,
		@CheckProcedureCache = 0 ,
		@OutputType = 'TABLE' ,
		@OutputProcedureCache = 0 ,
		@CheckProcedureCacheFilter = NULL,
		@CheckServerInfo = 1

	Known limitations of this version:
	 - No support for SQL Server 2000 or compatibility mode 80.
	 - If a database name has a question mark in it, some tests will fail.  Gotta
	   love that unsupported sp_MSforeachdb.
	 - If you have offline databases, sp_Blitz fails the first time you run it,
	   but does work the second time. (Hoo, boy, this will be fun to fix.)

	Unknown limitations of this version:
	 - None.  (If we knew them, they'd be known.  Duh.)

	Changes in v29 - August 23, 2013
	 - Added @OutputType = 'SCHEMA', which returns the version number and a list
	   of columns for a CREATE TABLE definition for the default outputs. We don't
	   include the actual CREATE TABLE part because you might want to use a table
	   variable or whatever.
	 - Added @OutputXMLasNVARCHAR. If 1, then the QueryPlan is outputted as an
	   NVARCHAR(MAX) instead of XML. This helps if you want to insert the
	   sp_Blitz results into a temp table. For instructions, visit:
	   http://www.brentozar.com/blitz/documentation/

	Changes in v28 - August 21, 2013
	 - Tom Meyer improved several backup checks so that they'll work if the master
	   and msdb databases have different collations, like if someone restores
	   msdb from another server with a different collation. (Please don't do that.)
	 - Fixed a bug in the VLF check that added a trailing space in the URL. This
	   broke the PDF output in the Windows app.

	Changes in v27 - August 6, 2013
	 - Whoops! Even more bug fixes in check 114. Thanks, Andy Jarman!

	Changes in v26 - August 2, 2013
	 - Whoops! Improved check 114 to skip SQL Server 2005, since the necessary
	   DMVs don't exist there. Thanks, Conan Farrell.

	Changes in v25 - August 2, 2013
	 - Andrew Jarman was the first to catch a bug in check 70 for named instances.
	 - David Todd suggested a tweak to make it easier to deploy this stored proc
	   in other databases.
	 - Added check for Adam Machanic's make_parallel function (115).
	 - Added check for basic NUMA config (114).
	 - Added check for backup compression defaulted to off (116), suggested by
	   David Todd.
	 - Added check for forced grants in sys.dm_exec_query_resource_semaphores,
	   indicating memory pressure is affecting query performance (117).

    Changes in v24 - June 23, 2013
	 - Alin Selicean @AlinSelicean:
	   - debugged check 72 for non-aligned partitioned indexes.
	   - improved check 70 for the @@servername variable.
	 - Andreas Schubert debugged check 14 to remove duplicate results.
	 - Josh Duewer added check 112 looking for change tracking.
	 - Justin Dearing @Zippy1981 improved @OutputTableName to export the results
	   to a global temp table.
	 - Katie Vetter improved check 6 for jobs owned by <> SA, by removing the join
	   to sys.server_principals and using a function for the name instead.
	 - Kevin Frazier improved check 106 by removing extra copy/paste code.
	 - Mike Eastland added check 111 looking for broken log shipping subscribers.
	 - Added check 110 for memory nodes offline.
	 - Added check 113 for full text indexes not crawled in the last week.
	 - Changed VLF threshold from 50 to 1,000. We were getting a lot of questions
	   about databases with 51-100 VLFs, and that's just not a real performance
	   killer. To minimize false alarms, we cranked the threshold way up. Let's
	   get you focused on making sure your databases are backed up first.
	 - Fixed bugs in @SkipChecks tables. Man, there's no way any of you were
	   using that thing, because it was chock full of nuts.
	 - Added basic SQL Server 2014 compatibility.

	Changes in v23 - June 2, 2013:
	 - Katherine Villyard @geekg0dd3ss caught bug in check 72 (non-aligned 
	   partitioned indexes) that wasn't honoring @CheckUserDatabaseObjects.
	 - Paul Olson http://www.SQLsprawl.com wrote check 106 to show how much
	   history is being kept in the default traces, and where they are. Only runs
	   if @CheckServerInfo = 1.
	 - Randall Stone suggested ignoring ReportServer% databases in the collation
	   checks. Prior versions of the checks were only ignoring default name
	   instances of SSRS.
	 - Added checks for "poison" wait types: THREADPOOL, RESOURCE_SEMAPHORE, and
	   RESOURCE_SEMAPHORE_QUERY_COMPILE. Any occurrence of these waits often
	   indicates a killer performance issue. Checks 107-109.
	 - Non-default sp_configure options used to be CheckID 22 for all possible
	   sp_configure settings. Now we use the range 1,000-1,999 for sp_configure.
	   This way, if you're writing a tool that outputs specific advice for each
	   CheckID, you can get more specific with the advice based on which
	   sp_configure option has been changed.
	 - Fixed various typos.

	Changes in v22 - May 6, 2013:
	 - Fixed new v21 case sensitivity bug reported by several users.
	 - Cleaned up some typos in script output.

	Changes in v21 - April 25, 2013:
	 - Easier readability - cleaned up the code with Red Gate SQL Prompt, plus
	   added comments explaining what's happening.
	 - Added @OutputDatabaseName, @OutputSchemaName, @OutputTableName. If set, the 
	   #BlitzResults table is saved into that. Only outputs the check results, not
	   the plan cache. Suggested by Robbert Hof and Andy Bassitt.
	 - Alin Selicean @AlinSelicean:
	   - Added check 100 looking for disabled remote access to the DAC.
	   - Added check 101 looking for disabled CPU schedulers due to licensing or
		 affinity masking.
	 - Chris Leavitt coded check 103 looking for virtualization.
	 - Mike Eastland suggested check 102 for databases in unusual states - suspect,
	   recovering, emergency, etc.
	 - Russell Hart coded check 104 looking for logins with CONTROL SERVER perms.
	 - Added check 105 looking for extended stored procedures in master.
	 - Moved temp table creation up to the top of the sproc while trying to fix an
	   issue with offline databases. I like it up there, so leaving it. Didn't fix
	   the issue, but ah well.
	 - Moved the old changes to http://www.BrentOzar.com/blitz/changelog/

				Note that by using sp_MSforeachdb, we're running the query in all
				databases. We're not checking #SkipChecks here for each database to
				see if we should run the check in this database. That means we may
				still run a skipped check if it involves sp_MSforeachdb. We just
				don't output those results in the last step.

				And that's the basic idea! You can read through the rest of the
				checks if you like - some more exciting stuff happens closer to the
				end of the stored proc, where we start doing things like checking
				the plan cache, but those aren't as cleanly commented.

				If you'd like to contribute your own check, use one of the check
				formats shown above and email it to Help@BrentOzar.com. You don't
				have to pick a CheckID or a link - we'll take care of that when we
				test and publish the code. Thanks!
