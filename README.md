My Script Collection

This is just a (script / articles) collection that I had since 2005 that now I'm saving to GitHub

*Note 1: Still need organization

*Note 2: Some of scripts I created by myself, some copied from somewhere in internet, sorry if that code is yours. Please let me know and I can put the credits to you
